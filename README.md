## About this application
I love house plants. There are [quite](https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/life/leisure/health-benefits-indoor-plants) [a](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cravings/201909/11-ways-plants-enhance-your-mental-and-emotional-health) [few](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419447/) studies on how indoor plants can be beneficial to the psychological wellbeing of occupants. But we must remember that they are living things (not just decorations!) and therefor need consistent care and attention in order to stay alive. 

I first created an iOS app during my Intro to Mobile Computing class that helped remind me when to water my plants, as well as keeping a log on each plant to record things like fertilization, repotting, pest control, etc. I realized I wanted to move this to a web based application because I didn't want to pay the (somewhat exorbitant) fees to keep it on the App Store. I decided this would be a great opportunity to get experience with a framework I've been wanting to learn for quite a while now: **Django**. So this app is my journey to learn Django, and to eventually deploy the app on DigitalOcean with Docker.
